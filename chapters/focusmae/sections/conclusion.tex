\section{Conclusion}
In chapter, we address the limitations of the previously proposed USG image-based GBC detection techniques, emphasizing the need for a paradigm shift towards USG video-based approaches. Our novel design, named \focusmae, strategically biases masking token selection from high-information regions and learns quality representations of GB malignancy. \focusmae achieves state-of-the-art results on USG video-based GBC detection.  
We anticipate that our work will be valuable to the community, sparking interest in the challenging problem of GBC detection from USG videos. Moreover, we showcase the generality of \focusmae by applying it successfully to a public lung CT-based Covid detection task, demonstrating its applicability across two modalities and diseases. This suggests that \focusmae could find broader use-cases in future, marking it a promising step towards versatile diagnostic solutions.
